# Summary of Project
This project pulled NCAC Division III Men's Lacrosse data into a usable format using R. The NCAC Men's Lacrosse Leauge consists of teams, including Denison University, Ohio Wesleyan University, Kenyon College, Oberlin College, the College of Wooster, Wittenberg University, Wabash College, Depauw University, and Hiram College. The websites are not all formatted in the same way, so two different methods were needed to scrape the feild players and goalie data. 

# Next Steps
- Explore the datasets
- Illustrate the data with visualzations
- Create statistical modeling with which players were named first team all conference, second team all conference, and honorable mention
